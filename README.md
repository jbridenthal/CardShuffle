# Card Shuffle

This project is a rewrite of my [Poker Planning](https://github.com/jbridenthal/PokerPlanning) project. As that project was written quickly and without much planning it has become harder to make proper changes to it. 

It uses .Net 8 (core), Blazor, SignalR and [Radzen](https://blazor.radzen.com/) tools.

This tool will allow teams of individuals to join team rooms and size work presented to them.
